# Clean Coders Functional Programming Course
This repo contains my work files created while working through the [Functional Programming course provided by Clean Coders] (https://cleancoders.com/series/clean-code/functional-programming).

The subprojects correspond to the episodes in the course:
1. Episode 53 - Introduction to Functional Programming
2. Episode 54 - Functional Mastermind

Code and solutions were created while watching and trying out ideas and solutions presented in the course videos.
